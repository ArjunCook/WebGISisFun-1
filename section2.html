        Prior appropriation is a legal framework that focuses on allocating water rights based on a system of priority and beneficial use. *In prior appropriation systems, the first person or entity to claim water rights and put the water to "beneficial use" typically has priority over subsequent users*. 
        Beneficial use refers to using water for specific purposes such as irrigation, industrial processes, or domestic use. This system prioritizes the efficient allocation of water resources, and it allows individuals or entities who have acquired water rights through the legal process to continue using the water even if others may have riparian rights. 
        Prior appropriation systems often involve the administration of permits and licenses to control water rights and manage allocation.
