        Westward Expansion and Water Scarcity: The expansion of settlers into the western territories of the United States presented new challenges due to water scarcity in arid regions.
         As a result, riparian rights were sometimes found to be impractical in allocating water resources. The need for a different legal framework led to the development of prior appropriation systems in some western states, where water rights were based on priority of use rather than land ownership.
