        Riparian rights are based on the principle of water access and use being tied to land ownership along a watercourse. Under riparian rights, *individuals who own land adjacent to a water source (such as a river or stream) have the right to reasonable use of that water*. 
        The key aspect of riparian rights is the concept of "reasonable use," which typically implies that the water should not be wasted or unreasonably impaired. In riparian systems, water is generally shared among the landowners with adjacent property, and their rights are considered equal. 
        Disputes over water usage are often resolved through negotiation or legal processes that aim to balance the interests of riparian rights holders.
