        Groundwater Regulation: While surface water allocation is often regulated under prior appropriation or riparian rights, the legal framework for groundwater allocation can be less clear. 
        In some states, groundwater is treated as a separate resource and may have distinct legal regimes. The division between surface water and groundwater rights and the management of shared aquifers can create grey areas and conflicts in water allocation.

        Interbasin Transfers: Transferring water from one river basin to another can pose legal challenges. 
        Prior appropriation and riparian rights may not adequately address the issue of interbasin transfers. The legal requirements, permitting processes, and the potential impacts on both the source and receiving basins can create complexities and disputes.

        Environmental Considerations: The traditional water allocation systems, whether based on prior appropriation or riparian rights, primarily focus on beneficial human use of water.
         As environmental concerns and the recognition of ecological values grow, the legal grey area arises regarding how water allocations should consider the needs of ecosystems and environmental protection. Balancing human water demands with ecological requirements can be a challenge within existing frameworks.
